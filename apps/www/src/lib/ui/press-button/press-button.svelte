  jixoai press button (registry/files/ui/press-button/press-button.svelte).
  Press law (theme .jx-press): hover grows the shadow only — the body
  never moves; active presses the body +1px into the page while the
  box-shadow's offsets counter-shrink 1px (the theme's *-press poses)
  — the shadow paint stays anchored, no pseudo layer. Variants change
  paint, never physics: fill / tonal / outline / ghost are the
  prominence ladder of the variant grammar (openspec/changes/
  variant-grammar); link is the grammar's one interaction exception —
  no frame, no press shadow, primary text, hover underline. Semantic
  color is hue injection, never a variant: --jx-fill + --jx-fill-ink
  (always together, one class: jx-pair-destructive), --jx-tonal
  (jx-hue-* intent utilities), --jx-outline ride class utilities at
  the call site (arbitrary properties remain the escape hatch;
  destructive action = fill + jx-pair-destructive — the pair
  utility injects --jx-fill WITH --jx-fill-ink in one class; the
  copied transient is tonal + jx-hue-success — copied left the union
  with the semantic names).

  One opt-in effect loop per button, modeled on the animation-svelte
  reference (github.com/SikandarJODD/animations, 2026-08-23 user
  request; recipes re-ruled r4 then r5, 2026-09-10): shimmer (a conic
  spark with dwell keyframes WALKS a ring-masked rim — nothing slides,
  nothing reads the host's background), pulse (sonar rings that fade
  AS they expand), rainbow
  (a five-stop train flowing around a mask-banded rim ring — the FULL
  ring, top and bottom alike — plus the blurred under-glow; the host's
  background is never touched), ripple (SVG ink from the activation
  point — css-animated on the svg node, softened by an svg
  feGaussianBlur, clipped to the host's silhouette, a round circle or
  the bevel diamond path, removed on animationend).
  Since effect-attachments (2026-09-09) the loop rides the ATTACHMENT
  channel, self-listening and host-free: this component is a PLAIN
  HOST (variant/state/aria/law only), the builders stay typed exports
  of the module script, and press-effect-runtime.ts owns the kernels:

    import PressButton, { shimmer, pressEffect }
      from '@ui/press-button.svelte';
    <PressButton variant="fill" {@attach pressEffect(shimmer({ speed: 4000 }))}>
      deploy
    </PressButton>

  The imperative kernels (layer spans/svg, host classes, vars — held to
  this spec's DOM/classname assertions) and the self-listening factory
  live in ./press-effect-runtime.ts; the animationend settle machinery
  in ./ripple.svelte.ts (the svg ink engine; css-timeline driven since
  r5); the keyframes + @property registrations stay in this folder's
  press-button.css.

  The async idiom (enhance-picker-feedback, 2026-08-30) — `loading`
  pose + `flash()` success, the two-step deploy pattern:

  - loading's ANCHOR CONTRACT: aria-disabled="true" (the element stays
    focusable — tab order unchanged — and stays opaque to WHY it is
    inert), pointer AND keyboard activation suppressed at the one seam
    every path funnels through (click — native buttons synthesize it
    from Enter/Space), and for `href` anchors the navigation itself is
    blocked (preventDefault). Never the disabled attribute: that would
    drop the button from the tab order and mute its semantics.
  - the spinner glyph takes the LEADING lane (before the label): the
    spin family's bracket cursor, inlined (registry items stay
    dependency-free) — keyframes in press-button.css (D1-exempt
    residue), reduced motion freezes on the static first frame.
  - the press law HOLDS in the loading pose: hover still grows only
    the shadow, active still presses +1px — loading is a SEMANTIC
    state, never a physics change.
  - success is a ONE-SHOT `flash()` helper (instance export via
    bind:this): the leading lane swaps to a ✓ check for 1.2s (default,
    ms overridable) with data-jx-press-state="success", then rests.
    ONE idiom, deliberately — declarative state toggles would invite
    half-wired two-step buttons.

  GROUP CONTEXT (r13, ButtonGroup upgrade; the Defaults read since
  context-defaults-economy 2.1): inside a ButtonGroup the button
  ADOPTS the group's variant when the consumer passes none —
  `explicit ?? ambient ?? 'outline'`, resolved through
  PressButtonDefaults (the family's single read point): the ambient
  lane reads the ONE paint zone key (the stamped-
  attribute law's consumer face: an explicit prop ALWAYS wins, the
  zone/group config is the inherited default, the own default never
  changes). The ladder itself is untouched — context selects a rung,
  never mints one.

  tw4 (2026-08-24): the button body was already utility-authored
  (variants + the --jx-press* pose wiring ride utilities — the press
  law's wiring is untouched); the effect loops move VERBATIM to
  press-button.css — keyframes, @property registrations, cqw math and
  ::after builds are all D1-exempt machinery, and splitting each
  layer's static half from its animated half would separate one
  logical unit across two sheets. The hosts' stacking pose (relative
  z-0) stamped with the effect branches until effect-attachments
  retired them — the runtime's own HOST_CLASSES stamp it now.
