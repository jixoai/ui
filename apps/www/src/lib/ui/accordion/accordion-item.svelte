<!--
  jixoai accordion item (registry/files/ui/accordion-item.svelte).
  The leaf half of the accordion pair: a styled <details>/<summary> with
  nothing added semantically — the browser already exposes the toggle,
  the disclosure state, and the keyboard contract. Drop it inside
  accordion.svelte (the group frame) or use it bare for a one-off
  disclosure.

  bind:open is supported (Svelte binds <details> open natively) — the
  exclusive mode on the group still works through the DOM, so manual
  open changes participate in the same radio behavior.

  The summary is a snippet (icons, badges compose); the marker is a CSS
  chevron that rotates on [open] — the native ::marker is retired.
  CONSTRAINT: no interactive elements (buttons/links) inside the summary
  snippet — they fight the summary's own click/keyboard contract. Put
  per-row actions in the body, or use a menu outside the accordion.

  tw4 (2026-08-24): utility-authored — the summary line paint (incl.
  hover/focus-visible) and the body paint live in the markup; ONLY the
  marker retirement, the chevron pseudo build with its [open] rotation,
  the ::details-content height machinery, and the reduced-motion kill
  stay in accordion-item.css (D1-exempt residue).
