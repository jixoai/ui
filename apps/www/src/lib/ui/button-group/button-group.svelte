  jixoai button group — the ROOT half (registry/files/ui/button-group/
  button-group.svelte, OpenSpec 2026-08-30-expand-form-family F2;
  r13 upgrade: context variant pass-down, on-demand separators, grid
  layout, overflow wrap/collapse).

  The shadcn Button Group counterpart, native to this registry's laws:
  an orientation/justify LAYOUT container that joins press-buttons
  (and icon-buttons) edge-to-edge over the hairline seam law. The
  container owns NOTHING but the layout and the seam — the buttons
  keep their own paint (variant ladder, density tier; physics is the
  one takeover, THE CLUSTER SHADOW below): the group paints no bezel
  of its own, so a joined row of outline buttons reads as ONE control
  with 1px seams instead of a 2px double border between neighbors
  (adjacent children collapse their borders via a -1px margin —
  button-group.css).

    <ButtonGroup label="export actions">
      <PressButton variant="outline">copy</PressButton>
      <ButtonGroupDivider />
      <PressButton variant="outline">move</PressButton>
      <PressButton variant="outline">delete</PressButton>
    </ButtonGroup>

  GROUP CONTEXT (r13, Owner acceptance; single-key law 2026-09-04):
  the group configures its children's paint through the PAINT ZONE —
  BUTTON_GROUP_KEY carries layout only — so one prop styles the whole
  joined row: `variant="ghost"` on the group is adopted by every
  child button that does not pass its own (PressButton resolves
  `explicit ?? ambient zone ?? 'outline'`: an EXPLICIT child prop
  always wins — the stamped-attribute law's consumer face). The
  ladder itself is never touched; context selects rungs, never mints
  one.

  THE CLUSTER SHADOW (Owner 2026-09-04): the joined row is ONE
  control, so it casts ONE shadow — the convex law moves from the
  buttons to the ROOT. The subtree rides FLAT by default (the group
  writes the press-texture key with raised=false: per-button convex
  shadows overlap at the -1px seams, the geometry defect this closes;
  an explicit raised on any child still wins, the zone resolution's
  explicit lane), and the root paints --shadow-xs — the press law's
  REST pose alone, hard offset, no hover growth, no active engrave:
  the root never presses ("不用做什么 actived 的效果，只需要去除阴影
  即可" — the Owner's wording). The `raised` prop resolves like the
  button's own: explicit ?? the enclosing texture zone (a card/dialog
  foot's flat scope carries through — a raised island inside a flat
  zone would be a defect) ?? the top-level convex default — with ONE
  carve: a NESTED group defaults OFF (it is one member of the OUTER
  cluster; one control, one shadow). raised={false} removes the root
  shadow and nothing else — the subtree's flat default is
  unconditional.

  THE SEPARATOR POLICY (ghost's seam): bordered rungs have the -1px
  seam law (their collapsed borders ARE the hairline), but ghost
  paints no border — the seam law has nothing to collapse. `separator`
  (explicit, or ON by default when the group's variant resolves to
  ghost) paints a 1px line in every seam slot, carrying the SEPARATOR
  INK LAW (separator/separator.css, 2026-09-01: a separator paints
  no color — the backdrop's own contrast ghost). THE REAL-DOM ERA
  (Owner, 2026-09-04: "我更希望上真正的 DOM 来做分割线"): the seams
  are REAL elements the GROUP owns as its own children — never a
  pseudo hanging inside a button (the r13/r14-13 ::before era is
  retired). The leading seam renders declaratively in the markup;
  the inter-button seams are injected between the VISIBLE direct
  children at runtime (the children snippet is opaque — neither
  Svelte nor CSS can interleave into it; the DOM can). Geometry is
  the divider's honest-1px-track law (a real track, flush junction
  edges — a -1px overlap would clamp to a zero-width grid track);
  paint is the unchanged ink engine (backdrop-filter, no color
  channel); the elements are aria-hidden decorative carriers. DIVIDER
  vs SEPARATOR ruling (composed era, Owner 2026-09-04): ButtonGroupDivider
  is the group's SEMANTIC boundary between consumer-authored clusters
  — a real, announced element COMPOSED over the Separator component
  (the ink is the same contrast ghost; the element form is
  Separator's W3C-first pair, the family adds only the junction
  geometry); the separator is the DECORATIVE seam between adjacent
  joined buttons (policy-driven, group-injected, invisible to AT).
  Both coexist: dividers between clusters, separators between buttons
  within a cluster (and never adjacent to a divider — that junction
  already has its line); the boundary's EXTRA weight is geometry, not
  ink — flush border·line·border against the intra-cluster collapsed
  1px seam.

  GRID, not flex (r13, Owner law — the 2D nature is accepted): the
  container is `inline-grid`. THE FLOW LAW (Codex B1 rework, pinned
  empirically on Chromium): without an explicit template, auto-flow
  ROW fills the ONE implicit column and grows ROWS (a vertical
  stack); auto-flow COLUMN fills the one implicit row and grows
  COLUMNS (the horizontal single line). So HORIZONTAL groups ride
  grid-auto-flow:column + auto columns (exactly the task's original
  wording — an earlier "row-major" reading was backwards and stacked
  every horizontal group vertically), VERTICAL groups ride the
  default row flow + auto rows. The wrap state swaps the horizontal
  flow to row + per-item stamped cells (below). The -1px seam
  margins carry into grid: an auto track sizes to its item's
  MARGIN-BOX contribution, so each -1px margin overlaps the neighbor
  by exactly 1px with flush group edges — the same law, the same
  selectors, no flex. The DIVIDER is the one geometry the flex era
  could afford and grid cannot: its old -1px/-1px pair made its
  margin-box NEGATIVE (a 1px element overlapping both neighbors),
  which auto tracks clamp to a ZERO-WIDTH track (the audit's
  `72.8px 0px` readout) — the grid-era divider owns a REAL 1px
  track with flush junction edges (button-group.css; the boundary
  reads border·line·border, heavier than the 1px intra-cluster seam
  — a boundary should). justify places the track cluster on the
  main axis (justify-content inline-axis for horizontal, the
  content-* utilities pack the row tracks' block axis for vertical
  — the same cluster-placement semantics flex had). Item-level
  justify-self is deliberately unused: tracks are content-sized and
  items fill them, so group-level packing is the whole alignment
  story. A nested ButtonGroup is ONE grid item for the outer seam
  (child-scoped selectors), so cluster joins never leak the inner
  seams outward.

  OVERFLOW (r13, horizontal only — a vertical stack overflows its
  block axis, which is the scroll container's business, not a
  button group's): when the joined row outgrows its available inline
  space (the container is max-w-full), the measured overflow state
  machine (ResizeObserver, hydration-time — the family-context DOM-
  derived AUTO exception) resolves one of two consumer modes:

    overflow="wrap" (default)  the row re-breaks into measured rows:
      each item is stamped with its greedy grid cell (gridRow/
      gridColumn inline placement — CSS cannot express per-row
      packing; the PLACEMENT is inline style, all PAINT rides the
      data-jx-* stamps) and data-jx-row-start (row leads drop the
      -1px seam + seam pseudo: they have no inline-start neighbor).
      Rows read row-major (DOM order = visual order — grid-auto-flow
      stays row; dense would backfill holes with LATER items and can
      visually reorder, which the DOM-order integrity law forbids).
    overflow="collapse"        overflow tail buttons fold into a
      DropdownMenu behind an icon-only IconButton trigger (⋯,
      popovertarget invoker — the platform path, zero component
      listeners). Hidden buttons keep their real DOM (display:none
      — out of the a11y tree and tab order, listeners intact); each
      menu entry is a DropdownMenuItem whose activation CLICKS the
      hidden button (the consumer's handler fires on the real
      element). The menu rides dropdown-menu's own keyboard contract
      (arrows/typeahead/Enter/Escape, focus returns to the trigger
      on selection or Escape; Tab light-dismisses — no focus trap).

  HYSTERESIS: overflow states and the collapse count are pure
  functions of the measured available width, but boundary resize
  jitter must not flap: entering overflow is strict (needs >
  available), LEAVING requires HYST margin (available - needs ≥
  HYST), and the collapse count grows only with the same margin.
  The measuring pass is atomic (reset stamps → read → restamp in
  one task, under the transient data-jx-measuring stamp that lays
  everything out — no intermediate paint). Static/no-JS path: no
  measurement ever runs, every button stays inline and visible —
  SSR renders the complete single row.

  ROLE LAW: the root is role=group — this is a grouping of RELATED
  ACTIONS, not a toolbar (toolbars are roving-tabindex collections of
  controls; every button here keeps its own tab stop, the platform's).
  Name it: `label` (aria-label) or aria-labelledby through the rest
  props — a nameless group is announced as nothing. The role is
  consumer-overridable through the rest props (an explicitly labeled
  toolbar is the consumer's explicit contract; this component never
  stamps toolbar by itself).

  THE toggle-group BOUNDARY (recorded law, see the docs page): the
  moment the children express SELECTION — a pressed state, an active
  value — this is the wrong component. Segmented selection is
  toggle-group's law (native radios/checkboxes, one form field). A
  button group is action-only: press, effect, navigate.

  Orientation: horizontal (default) or vertical; `justify` places the
  joined cluster on the main axis (start | center | end). Density is
  PROVIDED to the subtree, so the joined buttons adopt the group's
  tier without per-button props.
