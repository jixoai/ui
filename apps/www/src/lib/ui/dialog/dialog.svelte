  jixoai dialog (registry/files/ui/dialog/dialog.svelte).

  NativeHTML base (2026-08-20): the native <dialog> element driven by
  showModal()/close(). The platform supplies the focus trap, the Escape
  key (cancel event), an inert page behind, top-layer rendering, and
  closed-by-default (no-JS page loads never paint dialog contents inline).
  The component adds exactly two things: bindable open state, and a 120ms
  close fade (skipped under prefers-reduced-motion) whose layer choreography
  (surface sinks, shadow presses back) lives in the jx-surface law.

  Floating-surface law (2026-08-22): the panel carries jx-surface — the
  hard offset shadow is a REAL ::after layer, entry runs the
  @starting-style pull-apart, and variant='solid' | 'acrylic' | 'auto'
  picks the paint (auto: acrylic unless the environment asks for reduced
  transparency). The ::backdrop scrim is --scrim: semi-transparent black
  in light mode, white in dark mode — never a brand tint.

  tw4 (2026-08-24): utility-authored — the platform element keeps its
  geometry-only utilities (it still paints NOTHING; fill + border +
  blur stay the theme's jx-surface-body, the shadow the shadow layer),
  and the head/body/foot paint lives in the markup. ONLY the scrim
  pseudo and the x-glyph descendant scale stay in dialog.css
  (D1-exempt residue). The old reduced-motion block died with its
  targets: the WAAPI kernel owns the ::backdrop timeline now (the
  theme's kernel reduced-motion block kills it), and the x button's
  transition chain is the press law's own (jixoai.css).

  ROW RULER (r13 + the r14 tuning): the scroll ring (head/body/foot's
  common parent) is a single-column grid whose NAMED ROWS carry the
  dividing lines — Separator components sit in EXPLICIT 1px row tracks
  ([head] [sep-head] [body] [sep-foot] [foot]), edge-to-edge exactly
  where the retired borders sat. Zone presence is resolved here and
  STAMPED (data-sep-head / data-sep-foot on the host — the
  stamped-attribute painting law). THE r14 TUNING (Owner): the
  --jx-dialog-inset token and the [inset 1fr inset] column ruler
  RETIRED — the real content owns its geometry. The head zone is FLUSH
  by default — consumer head snippets span edge-to-edge.

  ZONES vs CONTENT (r14-9, Owner correction): the footer's slot
  architecture belongs to the footer REGION — carried by components,
  not by sibling snippets on Dialog. Dialog keeps the zones, the
  snippet transports, the ghost variant scopes (Context, written over
  head and foot), and the × close contract; the CONTENT faces are
  composition: <DialogHeader> (the title row / a custom flush head —
  rendered internally for the untitled default) and <DialogFooter> (the
  auto button-group at inline-end, the raw end slot). The footer
  snippet is the RAW full override of the foot zone — the actions/end
  sibling snippets are retired. No-subgrid environments fall back to
  the padding geometry (dialog.css, the law's mandatory fallback).
