  jxoai button variant scope (registry/files/ui/button-group/
  button-variant-scope.svelte, r14 tuning 2 — Owner: "Context 技术无法
  控制 DialogHeader/DialogFooter 里面的 button 的默认变体吗？").

  The zero-DOM half of the group's context: a SUBTREE-SCOPED variant
  default for buttons, with no layout attached. The layout half is
  ButtonGroup itself (grid, seams, overflow); this scope is what a
  DIALOG/CARD zone (header/footer) wraps around its content so every
  PressButton/IconButton inside — joined or free-floating — defaults
  to the zone's variant. A button's own explicit variant still wins
  (explicit ?? nearest scope ?? own default), and a ButtonGroup inside
  inherits the scope's variant when it sets none of its own
  (inherit-then-provide, the density maneuver).

  THE PHYSICS SEAM (Owner 2026-09-04): `raised` scopes the press
  texture default through the SAME boundary — a card/dialog FOOT zone
  declares raised={false} and its buttons ride flat (the engrave-tier
  inset press) unless an explicit prop says otherwise. It rides its
  OWN context key (PRESS_TEXTURE_KEY, owned by press-button), not the
  paint zone: the zone is paint policy and every ButtonGroup resets
  it, while physics must flow THROUGH joined groups untouched.
  Inherit-then-provide here too — a paint-only scope (variant, no
  raised) never un-flattens an enclosing zone.

  Renders its children and nothing else — no element, no paint, no
  seams; it is a context boundary, not a container.
