  jixoai dialog-footer (registry/files/ui/dialog/dialog-footer.svelte).

  The foot zone's button economy (r14-9, Owner correction): the slot
  architecture belongs to the footer REGION, carried by a component —
  not to sibling snippets on Dialog. Dialog's footer snippet is the RAW
  full override (use it and you own everything); this component is the
  standard foot you usually reach for:

    children  the action buttons — they auto-join ONE ButtonGroup
              packed at the row's inline end (the Owner's
              inline-end-actions-slot law; the buttons stretch the
              footer open). The ghost default arrives by inheritance
              from Dialog's zone scope — an explicit variant wins.
    end       the RAW inline-end slot (the Owner's footerEnd
              reference): present ⇒ it REPLACES the grouped
              arrangement entirely — the opt-out for non-button
              content or a fully custom cluster.
    label     the ButtonGroup's accessible name.

  THE OPENING LINE (r14-11 → r14-13, Owner): the actions cluster
  opens with a boundary line — but the line is BUTTON-GROUP's to draw
  (leadingSeam): it paints as the first button's own seam pseudo,
  flush by construction. A standalone Separator sibling here got
  detached by the foot grid's column-gap — the exact failure the
  Owner caught. With the group gone (the end face) the line goes with
  it: the bracket belongs to the cluster, not the zone.

  Standalone (outside a Dialog foot zone) it still renders the same
  grid — buttons then take their own default variants (and without an
  active seam policy the leading seam stays off).

<!-- THE FOOT GRID (r14 tuning 2 → r14-9 component face): NO zone
     padding — the grid controls dimensions. Everything hangs at
     INLINE-END (Owner): the cluster (the group, or the raw end slot)
     is content-sized and stretches the footer open; the narrow-screen
     reversal keeps actions reachable when the panel squeezes -->
