## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: the variant grammar (prominence ladder + hue injection)

Surface paint variants SHALL come from the one ladder — `fill` /
`tonal` / `outline` / `ghost` — plus PressButton's `link` interaction
exception. Semantic color is NEVER a variant name: intent is expressed
by injecting values into the four global hue slots (`--jx-fill`,
`--jx-fill-ink`, `--jx-tonal`, `--jx-outline`; theme-owned,
inheritable). The action/status split is mandatory: destructive
ACTIONS inject `--destructive` (the fill pair), error STATUSES inject
`--error` into the tonal slot. Variant paint rides token utilities in
the markup (tw4 utility-authored law); press physics (`.jx-press`)
never change with paint. Availability is per-component (see the
frozen table in openspec/changes/variant-grammar/design.md §4):
Badge fill/tonal/outline (default tonal, brand hue); InlineCode
tonal/outline (default tonal, locally neutral); Chip all four
(default tonal); PressButton fill/tonal/outline/ghost/link (default
outline); Alert outline/tonal (default outline — no fill/ghost:
banner readability). Valued `data-jx-*` hooks carry the variant
(`data-jx-badge`, `data-jx-alert`, `data-jx-press-button`,
`data-jx-chip`).

The injection seam is TWO-LAYERED (hue-injection-utilities,
2026-08-27): the CANONICAL form for the curated semantic set is the
theme's TW4 `@utility` intent layer — `jx-hue-primary | neutral |
error | success | warning | info` (tonal slot) and
`jx-pair-destructive` (fill + fill-ink together, making the
always-inject-both law structural; there is no `jx-hue-destructive`
— the action/status split holds by construction). The
arbitrary-property class (`[--jx-tonal:var(--error)]`) remains the
escape hatch for values outside the closed set; ONE form per slot in
a class list (cross-form mixing is not dedupable). `cn()` registers
the closed set as tailwind-merge dedupe groups.

#### Scenario: a failed status chip is authored

- WHEN a badge must read as failed
- THEN it is `<Badge variant="tonal" class="jx-hue-error">` (or the
  arbitrary equivalent) — never `tone="destructive"` and never the
  destructive ACTION hue

#### Scenario: a variant utility set is audited

- GIVEN any component's variant map after this change
- WHEN the source guard scans its markup
- THEN every variant's paint consumes the four global slots and no
  variant name encodes a semantic hue
